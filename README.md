# Interactive Clock in QT
---
This project is a an interactive analog clock created in QT using QML & C++. The hands on the clock can be adjusted manually using mouse controls; 
the functionality is accomplished:
- Without the use of the Image element
- Without the use of QtQuick.Controls module
- Using Rectangle, Repeater, Text, MouseArea components where applicable

Note
> There aren't source or qml sub-directories in the project since the QT framework doesn't seem to have created any, everything is contained in the same directory.
